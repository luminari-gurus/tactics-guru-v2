## Responsive controls: PR #119 integration

[PR #119](https://github.com/luminari-gurus/tactics-guru-v2/pull/119) integrates the reviewed rail/dock and isolated inspection with main `0b317e3`. Both review findings are repaired and their threads resolved. Integration commit `743bd0a1599df1b3c3e22a746f0b23086d2d1ad5` preserves the original PR ancestry, merged run progression, health bars and WebKit focus fixes.

The startup/style conflicts are reconciled by sharing the existing responsive shell between standalone battles and `/run`. Run boundaries hide that shell; active encounters show the correct encounter heading, actor and drawable board region. The existing run reload test reproduced the missing actor-container failure before repair and passes afterward on desktop, portrait and landscape. [QA and acceptance map](../qa/issue-111-battle-controls.md) record the implementation and review repairs.

Implementation and merge acceptance are complete. The PR records the final merge state and issue #111 closure. A merge commit preserves the reviewed ancestry; no history rewrite or release tag is warranted. The PR branch is retained because existing worktrees reference its history.

Follow-ups `1fe9e09` and `2ba14d9` correct stale encounter labels and keep restored dialog focus visible in the nested scroller. Broad verification passed 675 unit tests and all 480 browser cases. Final verification after those follow-ups passed 97 focused browser executions, 18 encounter and 21 run-item posttests, 167 content checks, both typechecks/build, strict OpenSpec and whitespace checks. The QA record distinguishes source revisions, initial failures, focused rechecks and retained evidence.

[OpenSpec tasks](../../openspec/changes/issue-111-responsive-battle-controls/tasks.md) are complete. The change remains active for its separate sync/archive workflow; preserve the already merged `battle-dialog-focus-return` scenarios when syncing. The [prior repair handoff](https://github.com/luminari-gurus/tactics-guru-v2/blob/2b419eff2f4183c3e9357d45b75caaeceb12bc70/docs/ongoing-projects/plan.md) and [prior main handoff](https://github.com/luminari-gurus/tactics-guru-v2/blob/0b317e3/docs/ongoing-projects/plan.md) preserve earlier evidence and dispositions.

## Follow-up work

- [#123](https://github.com/luminari-gurus/tactics-guru-v2/issues/123) adds mobile collapse/expand behavior. It remains open and should build on the final merged responsive shell and drawable-region contract, including `/run` encounters.
- [#127](https://github.com/luminari-gurus/tactics-guru-v2/issues/127) owns the deployed transfer and idle-budget failures; #57/#64/#81 retain their related acceptance. Preserve that work's ownership and evidence.
- #128 analytics/error logging, #59/#60 broader run/reward epics, and #83–#85 with PR #12 retain their separate scope. This merge does not establish release acceptance.

The standing [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) policy accepts Playwright/device emulation for device testing unless the caller specifically requests hardware. [PR #125](https://github.com/luminari-gurus/tactics-guru-v2/pull/125) recorded that policy; [PR #126](https://github.com/luminari-gurus/tactics-guru-v2/pull/126) delivered WebKit recovery-focus repairs and its own device-acceptance closeout. The [device audit](../qa/device-acceptance-2026-10-17.md) retains actual failures and source-bound measurements. This integration does not claim physical hardware, screen-reader or production deployment testing.

Delivered foundations remain: save/storage/Continue (#69/#72/#73), run progression and reward/item controls (#75–#80), map work (#87/#96–#99), signature effects (#106), responsive design (#108), shared geometry (PR #118), and unit health bars (#121/PR #124). See the [restart plan](../phaser4-restart-plan.md) and [technical design](../tech_design.phaser4.draft.md) for their contracts.
